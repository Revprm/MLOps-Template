# MLOps Infrastructure Template

This repository provides a template for building scalable and reproducible machine learning pipelines using modern MLOps tools. It demonstrates a complete workflow from data processing and model training to experiment tracking, deployment, and CI/CD.

## Features

  - **DVC**: For data and model versioning. ðŸ“¦
  - **Poetry**: For dependency management.
  - **MLflow**: For experiment tracking. ðŸ§ª
  - **FastAPI**: For serving the model as a REST API. ðŸš€
  - **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation. ðŸ¤–
  - **Modular Structure**: A `src` layout for cleaner, more maintainable code. ðŸ“‚

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.11+
  - Poetry
  - DVC

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd mlops-infra-template
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies using Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This command will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary packages.

## Usage

This project uses DVC to manage the machine learning pipeline, which consists of three main stages defined in `dvc.yaml`: `get_data`, `process_data`, and `train`.

1.  **Reproduce the full pipeline**:
    To run the entire pipeline from data downloading to model training, use:
    ```bash
    poetry run dvc repro
    ```
2.  **Running individual scripts**:
    You can also run the Python scripts individually:
      - `python -m src.data.make_dataset`
      - `python -m src.data.process_data`
      - `python -m src.models.train_model`

## Experiment Tracking with MLflow

This project uses MLflow to log experiment parameters, metrics, and models.

To view your experiments, start the MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

This will start a local server, typically at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Deployment as a REST API

A FastAPI application is included to serve the trained model as a REST API.

To run the API:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn src.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

You can then send POST requests to the `/predict` endpoint. Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/predict" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"sepal_length": 5.1, "sepal_width": 3.5, "petal_length": 1.4, "petal_width": 0.2}'
```

## Testing

Tests are in the `tests/` directory and can be run with pytest:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is triggered on every push and pull request to the main branch. It automates testing, code formatting checks, and Docker image builds.
