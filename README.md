# MLOps Template üå∏

A production-ready template demonstrating an end-to-end workflow for training, evaluating, and testing a machine learning model on the classic Iris dataset.

## üìã Overview

This project implements a full machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline to classify species of Iris flowers. It's designed to showcase best practices for building reproducible, automated, and production-ready ML systems.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- üì¶ **Data & Model Versioning**: Uses **DVC** to track datasets and models, ensuring experiments are fully reproducible.
- üîÅ **Automated ML Pipeline**: The entire workflow is defined as a reproducible pipeline in `dvc.yaml`.
- ü§ñ **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A **GitHub Actions** workflow automatically tests and validates the pipeline on every push and pull request.
- üî¨ **Experiment Tracking**: Leverages Git and DVC to manage experiments, allowing for easy comparison of results.
- ‚úÖ **Automated Testing**: Includes a test suite using **pytest** to validate data integrity, pipeline outputs, and model performance.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Pipeline Workflow

The core of this project is the DVC pipeline, executed by the `dvc repro` command. It runs the following stages in order:

1.  **`get_data`**: Fetches the raw Iris dataset from `sklearn` and saves it in `data/01_raw/`.
2.  **`process_data`**: Splits the raw data into training and testing sets, saving them in `data/02_processed/`.
3.  **`train_model`**: Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data and saves the serialized model to the `models/` directory.
4.  **`evaluate_model`**: Evaluates the trained model against the test set and generates a `reports/metrics.json` file with the key performance metrics.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized to separate concerns, making it scalable and easy to navigate.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.9+)
- Git
- DVC

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

    > **Note:** Replace `your-username/your-repo` with your actual GitHub repository details.

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    # On macOS / Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Initialize DVC:**

    ```bash
    dvc init
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Running the ML Pipeline

To execute the entire pipeline from start to finish, run the following command. DVC will automatically manage dependencies and run the stages in the correct order.

```bash
dvc repro
```

### Running Tests

To run the automated tests and ensure the project is functioning correctly, use `pytest`.

```bash
pytest
```
